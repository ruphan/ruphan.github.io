## What do I do?
I build computer vision systems for robotic perception, leveraging deep learning to enhance autonomy and functionality. My expertise includes designing robust algorithms and distilling foundational models for real-time performance on edge devices. Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, skiing and trail running, finding inspiration in nature and adventure to fuel my creativity and problem-solving skills.
